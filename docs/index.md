# acp-amp

acp-amp is a clean-room ACP adapter for Amp Code. It runs as a standard ACP agent over stdin/stdout and can be used from any ACP client (for example Zed or SuperQode).

Highlights:

- Python ACP server with strict JSON-RPC over stdio
- Small Node shim for the closed-source Amp SDK
- Compatible with any ACP client that can launch a subprocess
